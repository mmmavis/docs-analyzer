WTF is this and why should I care?\n3 - interested\n4 - high level participation\n\n^ how do we recreate that journey for others?\n^ test that hypothosis\n\nLanguage:\n\t* Our current language is self-referential and generic. “A community of people” could apply to the NRA. Get rid of the language that doesn’t say much.\n\t* Don’t need to skew the language too far into movement-building. Won’t appeal to the entire MozFest audience, especially if they've never been.\n\t* Experience brand of MozFest while you’re there is really strong. But how do we attract new people?\n\t* Look at other conferences that have weird, arcane content. How do they market their events.\n\n\nMozFest website:\n\t* Language feels old and stale. Need to stop re-using it.\n\t* Does the MozFest site become a respository for the outputs from the event?\n\nPlan of Action:\n1) Work Mark's thoughts into V2 of the speech bubble/messaging brief\n2) Once that's got Mark's signoff, work it into the comms plan template\n3) Comms plan will identify how we want to reach out to people\n4) In parallel, reach out to space wranglers to find the list of people we want to reach out to\n5) Roll this all back together into a comms\n\n\n"

Is it a chance for us to share our work with the community or to listen to what the community  have to say, ie the sessions they put forward?\nIf we want to share our work should we be somewhere we are a high value to the audience, have greater chance of spreading our work and ethos- being part of the larger pictures.\nIf we are using MozFest to listen to the community, what they are working on what they are debating and leveraging through session submissions. We will want to bring as many in as possible and be where they are most active or have the greatest chance of attending in large numbers.\n\n\nQ:How is MozFest a vehicle for leadership development? Do we take the skeleton of the festival to another country and leave our communities leaders in place to lead in London?\nAs we think towards 2020 how to we see Mozfest playing that lead role on our convenings calendar as our largest and most public event - is this through one large event in the UK, small mini events around the world moving our partners and our teams or allowing our estabalished partners in the UK take the lead with our gudience and MoFo teams recreate another version of the event elsewhere- ie start again\nDo we keep our UK event and creating a new version 2.0 in Asia or South America with new partners\n\n\nQ Do our partners make our festival and are our asset, tool and resource or are they a vessel to attract new audience to our work? \nShould we be moving to a country where we have access to a larger audience know of our product but are not fully aligned.\nOr should we move to where our most vocal audience/community is and use mozfest as a Leadership development tool\nCreating smaller subset events, led by us in the MozFest frame but using local content and talent\n\nAttendees:\n\t* 3 circle of attendees\n\t\t* Mozilla\n\t\t* Community and partners\n\t\t* Registered attendee and  invited guests- those who we want to work with, those who know what we do but dont necessarily agree with our work or align (yet ) with our work. This is always the largest group of new audience- this for me is our highest value\n\n\nThe venue\n\n\t* We stay in the UK not for our love of the city but for the love of the venue.\n\t* Its open, bright, well equipt, supportive. It is the epithonie of open, you can see all the floors, the heart of the festival.\n\t* We have embedded ourselves into their curriculum, their narrative, their academic program. \n\t* We use their pool of student talent over the weekend from fire wardens, to rigging team, to graphic design team.\n\t* We have hired past students in contract postitions for roles within the production team, Marc Walsh and Dosed.\n\t* We mentor their events team, assist in leadership development\n\t* We already have an acedemic scholarhship and we are potentially about to enter into a larger post graduate partnership\n\nThe local partnerships-\nBBC r&d, Met office, digital Me, EPIK, irights, and now the Arts Award, Tate and VnA\n\n\n\nThe cost\nThe are expanding at a fast rate and the cost of accommodating gets higher\nCost of good is increasing, contracters are expensive.\nThis is the 6th year in London, do we need to refresh!\n\n\nWho are our stakeholders\nAs we take next steps who else should be involved in this conversation?\n\n\nWild card\nMove next year but in 2018 move a portion of the event into more festival vibe, camping, summer, tents, fields, generators, music at night, sessions and talks during the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But we'd be lighter.\n\t\t* Reflective experiences/gallery walk\n\t\t* Fun house > fear house\n\t* The entry way needs to capture the spirit, but delimit traffic or be the only way into the space, right?\n\t* Question: Is the carnival/fun-house metaphor festival-wide or specific to this space?\n\t\t* The idea of showing people a haunted house and then taking them behind the scenes is great.\n\t* Potential things to connect/resurface:\n\t\t* Gaming space\n\t\t* A \"room\" people can control w/ IoT +1\n\t\t\t* We could cue some user controlled signage like the \"panic inc sign\"\" https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/\n\t\t* Team Rogue stuff\n\t* It would be a good challenge for staff and allies to prepare rigorously to be \"buskers\" that are like mobile Ignite talks.\n\t\t* Can Luke & co. write webby songs and perform?\n\t\t* Place for music/music making w/ tech on the floor?\n\t* Opportunity for BreakoutEdu-like experience w/ open IoT or a walled garden themed breakout room? Do we have web artists who could install?\n\t* I saw a project once that printed \"fortunes\" based on tweets - thinking \"Big\" Zoltar +1 this is hilariously awesome. +1 we need this!!! anyone has a termal printer we could use?\n\t\t* This + a tweetbot workshop = return to connecting educators, new learners w/ developers doing weird, personal, human things in this space\n\t* I love the idea of a \"ride\" - \"welcome to the internet, I will be your guide\" needs to be present.+1, this is great.\n\t* Sounds fun = think it'll be in how we balance the theme with being not too-theme-y\n//\n\nWalk-through:\n\t* Entrance: Programmable signage\n\t\t* Live-coded marquee\n\t\t* improved littleBits signs?\n\t\t* Barker w/ scheduling materials in lieu of scheduling poster\n\t\t* Virtual tickets (can they sign up so we text people before a session they want to join begins?)\n\t* Pass through hall of mirrors (also opp to reconnect audience w/ web art, human touch)\n\t\t* space for wanderlust engagement\n\t\t* Lightbeam interaction\n\t\t* ascii art generator\n\t* Open space\n\t\t* hack jam space\n\t\t* programming space\n\t\t* sit down next to workers and ask questions, contribute, hand-off projects, improv learning\n\t* Session spaces branch off of open space\n\t\t* how many spaces?\n\t\t\t* make'em w/ dividers?\n\t\t* what kinds of proposals?\n\t\t\t* could be for sessions\n\t\t\t* could be for labs\n\t\t\t* could be for galleries\n\t\t\t* could be for arcades\n\t\t* documentation station\n\t\t\t* localize with us?\n\t\t\t\t* document in your own language idea\n\t\t\t* create a response and tweet it\n\t* Questions\n\t\t* Connections - will there be an IoT space?

Disregard and move ahead as appropriate.\n\t\t* Agree w/ Andre re: comms, but also worry about the event itself - web literacy is for all; mentorship, service, and community projects connect to what we do, as well, and to emergent open leadership curriculum, FWIW. not clear on what the worry is\n\t\t\t* Is time spent convincing people that they can teach/they are teachers better than time spent on web lit is for all and you can share it, broadly?\n\t\t* Is there a metaphor that does more of what we want and less of what we don't want? (i.e. competing w/ YouthZone)\n\t\t\t* e.g. mentor fair\n\t\t* Is there some unpacking to do about YouthZone based on last year?\n\t\t* Are we learning, leadership, or web literacy space?

For MLN? For participants? For facilitators?\n\t\t* this is a good question without a simple answer (as always). OK, the simple answer: \n\t\t\t* For MozFest in general: advocates for the open web.\n\t\t\t* For MLN: mostly our friends and community members; educators using or co-creating Mozilla resources, who have traditionally been out-of-school time or informal educators and these days are club captains; Some (small) number of random walk-ins or local formal educators; \n\t\t* Who are we trying to reach this year AND who *can* we reach?\n\t\t\t* Non-local, non-Mozilla folks tend to have stipends: they submit a good proposal, they're accepted, we stipend their travel OR they're already close friends we know we want to be there;\n\t\t\t* unpack what reach looks like:\n\t\t\t\t* local vs. remote – bring people in live without having to be there\n\t\t\t\t* direct vs. indirect – does activity at MozFest extend beyond MozFest (train the trainer, design for audiences)\n\t\t\t\t\t* our direct audience doesn't have to be our target audience\n\t\t\t\t\t* our focus could be \"reach the most learners possible\"\n\n\t* Who has shown up in the past? Do we have demographic info? Do we know why they show up? What they love & what they want to see improved?\n\t\t* Not great data on this. Mostly it's folks who either a) can afford a ticket to London, b) are sent there on Mozilla funds, or c) are Europeans, namely Brits. There's an incredible diversity for a tech gathering, but a more modest one for what you might expect from a global gathering;\n\n\t* What new experiences, backgrounds, ideas, thoughts do we want to see represented at MozFest? What are their barriers for entry?\n\t\t* This is a great question, it's exactly the sort of thing that I can take to our team for some input!\n\n\t* What does DARCI mean?\n\t\t* It's a decision/responsibility matrix adapted from RACI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix\n\t\t* We add D for Decider in order to make power dynamics transparent. The Decider has ultimate oversight;\n\t\t* You can see a drafty DARCI below for this work;\n\t\t\t\t* Decider: TBD\n\t\t\t\t* Accountable: Robert (w/ support from Kim)\n\t\t\t\t* Responsible: Community Wranglers\n\t\t\t\t\t* Kim\n\t\t\t\t\t* Su\n\t\t\t\t\t* Simeon\n\t\t\t\t* Consulted/Helping:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Amira Dhalla\n\t\t\t\t\t* Julia Vallera\n\t\t\t\t\t* Chad Sansing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Andre Garzia\n\t\t\t\t\t* Simona Ramkisson\n\t\t\t\t\t* Lainie DeCoursy\n\t\t\t\t* Learning:\n\t\t\t\t\t* \n\t\t\t\t* Informed: \n\t\t\t\t\t* Learning Team\n\t\t\t\t\t* Learning Community\n\n\t* So many cool ideas are being shared/incubated during the teachtheweb curriculum workshops. How can we facilitate their next steps?\n\t\t* This is exactly on point. That's what we'll want to do over the next 2-3 months. Create a space that invites folks participation and motivate them to show up!\n\nTODOs for Friday 22 call\n\t* Kim: Follow-up with Chad about us doing a curriculum workshop on preparing a proposal for MozFest \n\t* Robert : get a list of all the Mozilla Learning Activities.\n\t\t* working on this... got some information, need to compile\n\t* Robert: Try to get some feedback from the MozFest crew on demographics of attendees (where do they come from);\n\t\t* They don't collect this information!!! We've got nothing to answer this question with.\n\t\t* Trying to get a sense of what % of attendees were funded by Mozilla to attend.\n\n\n\n==========================================================================\nStaff Crew Check-in on 4/12\n\nAgenda\n\t* (15 min) Let's get it all out there!\n\t* (5 min) Robert's Approach\n\t* (10 min) Timeline & Logistics\n\t* (15 min) What's missing\n\t* (5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude\n\n\n(15 min) Let's get it all out there!\nWhat brings you to the call this morning? What's your MozFest passion? \nIf a MadLib helps here, let's go with: I'm joining this crew to make sure __________________ is represented and/or we don't let _________________ happen again.\n\t* Andre: I'm joining this crew to make sure fun and creativity +1 are represented in all our actions\n\t\t* too many sessions crammed into a short time!\n\t\t* my favorite mozFest thing is EXPLORING! I love to wander around and be surprised by stuff.  I wish this could be facilitated.\n\t* Julia: I am joining to make sure we build new relationships/friendships through simple FUN +1 so we don't exhaust people again. (been exausted there before, know the feeling)+1\n\t* Simona: I'm joining to make sure to make sure is that we grow and better embed the inclusion and diversity piece is represented in more than one dedicated space and that we see it anchored in core programming i.e speakers, spaces and sessions +1+1 +1\n\t\t* quality of sessions was affected by...\n\t\t* making sure that people feel like this is a place to come back and work again\n\t\t* Working with speakers and session leaders – logistics and facilitation are not completely removed from each other +1\n\t* Chad: I'm joining to make sure we create inclusive, welcoming spaces for playing, making, and learning outside sessions and other more formal spaces; I'd like to make sure we don't lose large, widely differentiate-able spaces for hackery. +1 (2016 is the year of the sandwich printer) YAH.\n\t\t* The part that blew my mind as a first-time participant was having the time and agency to choose which worthwhile thing to do in depth over the whole weekend in community - there was nothing like that in traditional NA public education for me until I could bring some back. <3\n\t* Robert: I'm gonna add my two cents below ;) +1 to everything above!\n\t* \n\nDo you have an idea(s) or things in the works that we should definitely know about?\n\t* See Amira's TEAM ROGUE LEARNING notes below or in this pad: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfestteamrogue (feel free to add notes or ideas!) <3 <3 <3 this pad, so many good ideas!!! plusses+1\n\t* I would like to see an incubator/hacker/maker space. <-- I want this too! \n\t* I would like to see some sessions become a combined ignite sessions to \"zip\" the amount of content in a fun, rigorous way for folks who enjoy such talking events.\n\t* It would be great to have a space session that kicks off Mozfest similar what AMC did on teaching people to be good listeners, supportive \n\t\t* Seconded :) \n\t\t* third - music/movement is good to warm up\n\t* Can we have MLN Picnic?\n\t\t* Bring your own sandwich supplies, put them into the Run, Sandwich, Run! arrays, and eat what you generate. I have some tomato and lettuce toners here... :)+1\n\t* I would like designated time for reflection at the end - it was very helpful to do this with our Diverse leaders folks last year\n\t* Web Literacy Leaders - this program (developed by An-Me and Chad/me) and its first cohort will likely launch ahead of MozFest. We would like MozFest to be an opportunity for them to have a F2F gathering and some responsibility for sharing the OER they develop or facilitating/sprinting on related work.\n\nFlags\n\t* Youth Zone – when they ran out of room they annexed the MLN space in a way that was disruptive\n\t* There is a tension between giving wranglers and \"pathfinders\" agency in organizing the work and then relatively late-appearing instructions from the event team.\n\n(5 min) Robert's Approach\nRobert shares what he'd like to make sure that we lead with...\n\t* Doing less means compromising more (appreciate the difficulty here)\n\t* We let our community space wrangler lead and make decisions that are informed by our deep knowledge of this space, but driven by them\n\t* \n\n\t* Questions\n\t\t* What are the mechanisms to make sure the team is informed?\n\t\t\t* let's deep dive on that below here, but basic piece is that Robert is the go-between and we can create new spaces for doing that too, but their not \n\t\t* Can we make a DARCI for this?\n\t\t\t* YES! Good call:\n\t\t\t\t* Decider: ??? Not 100% Sure but guessing Sarah?\n\t\t\t\t* Accountable: Robert\n\t\t\t\t* Responsible: Community Wranglers\n\t\t\t\t* Consulted: MLN Staff MozFest Crew\n\t\t\t\t* Informed: Whole MLN Team\n\t\t\t* Deadlines, clear accountability and expectations are key \n\t\t\t\t* Strong suggestion is to reverse engineer a schedule from last year w/ best guess deadlines and mentor texts shared ASAP.\n\t\t\t\t\t* thanks Chad, this is great.\n\t\t\t* We are using a variation of DARCI here in Rio which might be a good idea for MozFest with the following roles:\n\t\t\t\t\t* One person responsible < this is what we call accountable and I would stick to that language\n\t\t\t\t\t* Any number of people consulted/helping < I would call \"helping\" as responsible\n\t\t\t\t\t* Any number of people as LEARNERS/apprentices on that task < I like this... need to think about it a little bit, but the spirit is great maybe also \"shadowing\"\n\t\t\t\t* So with this system we usually have 1 responsible person, 2 people being consulted and helping and 1 or 2 apprentices learning about that type of task.\n\n\n(10 min) Timeline & Logistics\n\t* April – solicit staff and community member input that can inform our Purpose Statement at the Berlin MozFest retreat\n\t\t* Robert to use weekly MLN staff calls to get staff input\n\t\t* Wranglers to use regional coordinator calls, club captain emails, Hive calls, community calls, curriculum calls, etc. to solicit input\n\t* May – Berlin retreat: nail down space logistics and determine a Purpose Statement for the Mozilla Learning space at MozFest\n\t\t* Before we as a team begin to really plan out the logistics for things like what's in Amira's pad we should invite our community to respond to us.\n\t\t\t* Time is a major blocker here;\n\t\t\t* Can we create a hybrid? Where we are prepared but also accommodate folks;\n\t\t* Socialize this out with our staff and communities ASAP to get their interpretations\n\t\t* Suggestion: Have a timeline and mentor texts for the first task coming out of the retreat.\n\t\t\t* what do you mean by \"mentor text\" \n\t\t\t\t* \"Here is what you should comment on GH to 'claim' a session.\" \"Here is an acceptance email.\" \"Here is an email extending a travel stipend.\" \"Here is a Google Form you can send to get passport and travel information from stipended presenters.\"\n\t\t* Suggestion: Try to establish an expectation of how much time there will be from each ask until its task is due (say 2 weeks or whatever) and commit to having mentor texts/resources/calls schedules ready to go out with each ask.\n\t\t* Suggestion: Begin office hours for community space wranglers. Maybe rotate as staff helpers. Every two weeks starting in May; we each do two w/ Robert or an event team member?\n\t\t* Suggestion: Prep and practice with a dummy repo if we're using GH again and share processes for articulating the differences between labels and milestones and resolving conflicts between groups that want the same session.\n\t\t* Suggestion: Community Wranglers Podcast. Get them all talking about the experience, share their stories! Boom.\n\t\t* Suggestion: badges? Recognize all their efforts...\n\t* June – Request for proposals opens! \n\t\t* Use community calls and spaces to motivate proposals\n\t* July\n\t\t* Suggestion: do something in July so as not to lose momentum; maybe work with space wranglers to develop kick-off events modeled after inclusion work? Participation guide for Mozfest?+1\n\t* August – Start proposal review\n\t* September – Send acceptances < i wish this could happen sooner +1+!+1(also if it comes to if funding is involved) OK, I'll try to get a better assessment of this so we can feel reassured or anticipate this as a major blocker.\n\t\t\t* Volunteers/Mozilla Community goes crazy with anxiety waiting for acceptance letters  (or maybe it was just me) yap.\n\n\n(15 min) What's missing\nWhat is missing from the plan above? What/who should we include in this plan?\n\t* July.\n\t* Roadmap for community wranglers so they never feel lost.\n\t* Inclusion deep-dive in session evaluation, selection, and planning  -  from Simona. +1 from Chad.\n\t* Answer me this: How do we ensure that we are doing our utmost best to deliver quality programming - from Simona. +1 from Chad.\n\t* Time and space for co-designing the kinds of spaces and events we'd like BEFORE the last three weeks before MozFest - from Julia. +1 from Chad +1+1\n\t* Can we sync the topics for the curriculum workshop events with the areas inside the MLN space so that our calls pave the way to mozFest? \n\t\t* Kinda sorta - we try to follow the MLN editorial calendar, but we also break ranks sometimes to support specific projects with time-constrained needs; so....definitely for a summer episode, but maybe not for all 3 summer episodes? Definitely for October? Thats good! If we have just a number of calls in sync that already shows movement towards mozFest which is the whole idea. :D\n\t\t* We can start spinning this up w/ planning for calls after May, which is set on youth civic engagement.\n\n\n(5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude\nHow to stay connected? How do you want to be involved?\n\t* Staying connected beyond calls: Can we have a space on the mattermost/chat.mozillafoundation.org thing? It would allow for cool async comms and also for informal chats!+1\n\t* Keep this group as the consulted staff team – bi-weekly meetings\n\nWhat is your takeaway from this call? What is the single most important thing you are leaving with or excited about? How would you like to remain included?\n\t* Excited to have more time to plan and that we will have three community members to build this with\n\t* Structuring the process ahead of time, but not the product, shows both care for our wranglers and trust in them.\n\t* Definitely big +1 on the start time this year \n\t* I loved all the fresh ideas and how mozFest will be always kept on the bleeding edge of awesomeness thanks to you folks.\n\t* \n\nKudos, thanks, acknowledgements, positive reinforcements, things to work on next, constructive feedback:\n\t* To Robert for all the awesome work\n\t* Major love to this team! \n\t* Robert le Robert - wrangle on! This is a great team to be a part of - thoughtfulness and compassion abound with deep expertise.'Ca\n\t* \n\t* Thank you all for your deep knowledge and commitment to making this awesome! Keep the feedback coming.\n\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\nNotes from Check-In w/ Amira Dhalla on 4/11\n\n\\/\\/\\/\\/TEAM ROGUE LEARNING\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\nhttps://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfestteamrogue\n\n\t* Engaging staff to vision what they think is cool and fun\n\t* Having sessions that respond to the theme, but having areas that really produce experiences\n\t* We have SO MANY, WAY TOO MANY sessions in our space and staff never get to go and attend other sessions\n\t* For staff (and maybe anyone) we're focused on aspects where we can dip in and out\n\t* A three-day long experience may be the wrong level of commitment\n\t* A place where people can discuss challenges and opportunities will work for some folks\n\t* A good example of a good experience:\n\t\t* David Ascher think at Orlando\n\t\t* A teach the web relay-race – something like the science sprint or Laura Hillger's science sprint\n\t\t* or a weekend-long skill-share handoff – sit down, learn a skill, hand it off to the next person before they leave\n\nOn getting broad community input\n\t* If we're getting community input, we need to set some clear boundaries and manage expectations about how input will be used\n\t* Simeon or others can definitely take 5 minutes and then there's a monthly email that goes to all coordinators and club captains – Amira is definitely the best POC\n\n==========================================================================\n\nCall\nSend SMS\nCall from mobile\nAdd to Skype\nYou'll need Skype CreditFree via Skype\n\n\n\n\nNotes from All-Hands session\n\t* Concerns around \"carnival\" theme\n\t\t* interpretation of carnival\n\t* Need to contextualize the theme for different audiences - connect to different outcomes we're after\n\t* Need better articulation of what the value is for coming to mozfest / facilitating \n\nMaking the invitation to mozfest more inviting - making the web more inviting\nHelp fuel how mozilla approaches learning in 2017 and beyond\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTxPRi_LDOk - web literacy leaders video from mozfest 2015\n\nWho do we want to invite to propose sessions?

We struggle to judge our impact, and leverage that knowledge to tell our story and improve our programs. We don’t have an effective way to share it with people, on social networks, with our institutional allies, and individual partners. (People within the org don't know what successes we've had (related to our issues agenda), even harder for outsiders to find out)\n\tOpportunity: An ongoing view of network artifacts enables us to elevate the best work of our members, a valuable incentive for participation. When we build a better practice to surface and amplify these artifacts, we can also better understand and demonstrate the value that the network provides to each node in the network.

How and when we do this is part of what will be developed in H2.\n\n\t* How is this incorporated into out Convenings - these are the questions we should be thinking about ...\n\t\t* How can we increase the # of people that get our survey - ie. member contact information\n\t\t* How can we increase the # of people that answer the survey\n\t\t* How can we increase the number of connections that our members are making - ie. adding new members and connecting them with existing members\n\t\t* How can we make these connections stronger\n\t\t* How can we increase their alignment with our issues and Mozilla\n\t\t* \n\n\t* Next Steps:\n\t\t* Research  the current role data collection has in the MLN hubs\n\t\t* We did not have historic data specific to this KPI, so we could not yet set useful targets.

Our goal here is to expand our design vision as a group, and highlight ideas that could impact design across MOCO and MOFO.\n\t\t* Activity - talk about heroes, trends, sacred things, baggage\n\t\t* Outcome - deeper an understanding of what makes each other tick, and some inspiration to bring back to our projects. \n\t\t* Impact - could inform some content on our design repo home, could reignite principals stuff, inform brand/identity input\n\n\t* Part 2: Mozilla rebrand hack: MOCO branding has defined Mozilla brand attributes. Do they align with the design attributes we defined in 2015? Let’s evaluate and leave with a shared set of attributes we express every time we design a product or project.\n\t\t* Context: Ideally a couple of designers attend the Brand open house Wednesday, 6/15 at 4:00 PM in the Metropole Hotel []\n\t\t* Prep: Links, slides, and print outs of the MOCO branding attributes and our 2015 design attributes\n\t\t* Activity\n\t\t\t* discuss and document feedback\n\t\t\t* Review moodboards https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/issues/39\n\t\t* Outcome – feedback goes to advisory committee\n\t\t* Impact – a moar awesome brand that serves our advocacy and the Network \n\n\t* Part 3: MOFO design repo: Will start with a postmortem on collaborative design studio efforts since Whistler. What worked, what didn't, what do we want to do next. Big question, how do we want to work in the new org structure. (MLN / Advocacy) ? What do we expect from each other moving forward?\n\t\t* Context: We need a home for recruitment, universal alignment, and resource gathering. We lost our page on build dot mofo and might benefit from something on an independent repo. \n\t\t* Prep: \n\t\t\t* https://github.com/mozilla/build.webmaker.org/issues/104\n\t\t* Goal: Have a home for\n\t\t\t* Recruiting \n\t\t\t* Universal design\n\t\t\t* Assets\n\t\t\t* Principles etc\n\t\t* Activity: \n\t\t\t* Dig up and review prior build dot mofo content\n\t\t\t* Review benchmarks\n\t\t\t\t* https://standards.usa.gov/\n\t\t\t* Discuss iteration\n\t\t\t* Use of moodboards\n\t\t\t* Talk about Learning and other sites and how do handle transitional styles that will always transitional\n"
